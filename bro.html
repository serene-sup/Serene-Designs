        Mechanical Engineer's Portfolio: Redesign

    <h2 class="s-h2">OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p class="s-para">
        I took on the task of redesigning Kevin Supakkul’s mechanical engineering portfolio. Kevin wanted a platform on which he could display his projects and share them with potential employers and recruiters for engineering companies. He had been using a free blogging website as a means of compiling his work and voiced to me that, functionality-wise, the site met his needs, but aesthetically-wise, he and I both agreed there was room for improvement.

    <h2 class="s-h2">THE PROCESS</h2>
    <h3>Defining + initial thoughts</h3>
    <p class="s-para">
        Since this portfolio was something that would be shared with professionals, Kevin and I decided we should go for a classy, sophisticated feel. With this in mind, I went with an overall dark grey color and Raleway font. I also wanted to use a background image with dark overlay to give off the classiness we wanted. For the image, I settled on a gear-faced watch-- the gears represent a typical piece of hardware associated with mechanical engineering and the watch represents Kevin’s appreciation for them.  
    
    </p>
    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p class="s-para">
        I began by ideating and making low-fidelity sketches in my notebook and mid-fidelity mock-ups using Adobe XD. I then moved on to creating a high-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD.
        <br>
        <br>
For the previous design, I found it difficult to navigate and see Kevin’s projects because of the blog-post style layout. Because of this, I opted for a clickable block to display pictures and titles of the projects. I also envisioned using CSS to overlay a short description of the project over the image as the user’s mouse hovers on top of the project’s section. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/bro-proj-old.png" style="height: 700px; margin-right: 100px; ">
        <img src="images/bro-proj-re.png" style="height: 700px">
        
        
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        
The 'About' page was not only void of information, but also had a layout that was difficult to apply to a career-type profile. I redesigned the page in a way that would showcase Kevin’s skills, background, and contact information so his information would be easily accessible by recruiters.
