        SEOULA: web design and development

        A creative dance team comprised of students with an unchanging passion for dance and Korean-American pop culture.

    <h2 class="s-h2">OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p class="s-para">
        As SEOULA began growing as an organization, it’s information became increasingly scattered across its social media platforms, making it more and more difficult for current and potential members to access their desired SEOULA content and get answers to questions. After 3 months of joining the team and becoming the team’s Graphic Designer soon after, I wanted to create a website for SEOULA as a place where all our content and information can be compiled into one, easy-to-access source.
    
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="role">ROLE</h3>
    <p>This project is the first project in which I single-handedly designed and developed by using Adobe XD and HTML/CSS to design, prototype, test, and develop the website. I taught myself HTML and CSS and scoured the web for Adobe XD tutorials. I also reached out to the other SEOULA staff members for feedback on the design and to ensure the website was the desired representation of our team. </p>
    
    <h2 class="s-h2">THE PROCESS</h2>
    <h3>Defining + initial thoughts</h3>
    <p class="s-para">
        Upon my collaboration with the club’s executive staff members, we decided we wanted the website to have an elegant, classy feel that also displayed a sense of community and trust that is instilled in our team. We also determined that our demographic consists mainly of college students. With all this in mind, I decided to opt for a darker color scheme to give off the elegant and classy feel and chose the Roboto Font to give off a modern feel for our young-adult demographic. I also compiled the team pictures and individual shots from our photoshoots for the team-community feel. 
    
    </p>
    <h3>Design Process</h3>
    <p class="s-para">
        I began by listing out the different pages that would be included in the website and then made low-fidelity sketches of each page in my notebook and mid-fidelity mock-ups using Adobe XD.
        Once I had my wireframes down, I moved on to creating a high-fidelity prototype in Adobe XD.

    </div>
    
    <h3>User-Testing</h3>
    <p class="s-para">
        After 2  rounds of testing the hi-fi prototype, I had received valuable feedback and made multiple changes.
        <br><br>
        A professional UX designer I had spoken to and presented this project to for feedback pointed out that the grey background on the “About” page clashed with the bright yellow text, which made it difficult to read and was an unusual color combination. Additionally, the rounded corners were inconsistent with the pointed corners of the header and the rest of the corners in the website.

    <div class= "abt">
        <img src="images/aboutv1.png" class="abt1"><img src="images/aboutv2.png">
    </div>
    <p class="abt-desc"> (Please note that the descriptions differ because I received an updated description after I sent my fellow SEOULA staff members the first prototype for review.)</p>
    
    <p style="margin-top:70px"> I also went through 3 different versions of the “Contact” page. 
The first version felt incohesive in comparison to the rest of the website due to the bright background and blue overlays. The second version was the desired aesthetic but consisted of a lot of unnecessary white space in the “email” section that make the page more cluttered than it needed to be. The third version was closest to what I had in mind and consisted of the aesthetic of the second version while also reducing the extra white space. 
</p>
    
    <div class="contact-vs">
    <img src="images/contactv1.png" style="margin-left: 7%"> <img src="images/contactv2.png"> <img src="images/contactv3.png"> 
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="s-h2">REFLECTIONS</h2>
    <p>As my first UX project and first project in which I single-handedly designed and developed in its entirety, I ran into a lot of bumps and uncertainties and learned a lot through trial and error and endless Google-ing. Though a challenging process, this was an exciting project to tackle. I discovered a lot of resources and  
Prior to taking on this project, I had only been exposed to the UX/UI and design worlds for ~4 months, so this was a great way for me to kickstart my design journey and grow more and more as a designer. I learned that, through endless Google-ing, one can always eventually find the answer to my question. With more experience in the future, I hope to be more creative with my designs and layouts and experiment more with effects using JavaScript.
